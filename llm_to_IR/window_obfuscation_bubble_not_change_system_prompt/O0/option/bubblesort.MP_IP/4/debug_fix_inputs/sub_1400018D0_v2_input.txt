I can generate the LLVM IR, but I need two clarifications to ensure it’s valid per your strict rules:

1) The call target “near ptr loc_1400027B5+3” is a local code label with an offset, not a proper symbol. LLVM IR cannot name a callee with “+3”. Do you want me to:
- treat it as an external function symbol with a chosen name (e.g., sub_1400027B8) and declare it, or
- call it via an absolute address using inttoptr(i64 0x1400027B8 to <fn-ty>*)?

2) The string symbols aUnknownPseudoR, aDBitPseudoRelo, aUnknownPseudoR_0 are referenced via LEA but their exact sizes aren’t provided. Per your rule 5, string/array sizes must match exactly. Do you want me to:
- declare them as opaque single-byte globals (i8) so only their addresses are used (no size assumptions), or
- provide the exact byte lengths so I can declare them as [N x i8] constants?
