; === ERROR LOG END ===

I can’t produce correct LLVM IR from this snippet as-is because key parts of the function body are missing and one call targets a raw code address rather than a symbol:

- The range between 0x140001FA4 and 0x140001FC0 is elided. This likely contains a critical mov ecx, [rsp+...] restore (or equivalent) that determines the value assigned to r8 at 0x140001FC0. Without it, SSA construction would require inventing values, which violates the rules.
- The range after 0x140001FEA up to the function end (0x140002009) is also elided. As shown, control flows into an apparent infinite loop (jmp short loc_140001FDE) with no visible epilogue/return. Emitting IR for that would be incorrect without the missing blocks.
- The call “near ptr loc_1400027ED+3” is to a code address that is not a symbol. In LLVM IR I must either:
  - Call a declared function symbol (requires a real symbol name), or
  - Call an inttoptr-constructed function pointer to an absolute address. That would bake in an image-base-dependent absolute and is not linkable/relocatable in the normal MSVC/PE model, and would violate rule 1 if the absolute isn’t explicitly provided as a symbol.

To proceed while strictly following the rules, please provide:
- The missing instructions between:
  - 0x140001FA4 and 0x140001FC0
  - 0x140001FEA and 0x140002009 (including the function’s terminating path)
- A proper symbol name (and calling convention) for the target at “loc_1400027ED+3” so I can emit a declare and a normal call.
- Confirmation (or types) for the referenced data symbols:
  - dword_1400070E8 (i32?)
  - qword_1400070E0 (i64?)
  - unk_140007100 (opaque byte object or specific struct?)
- Optional: prototypes for sub_140015A7A and sub_140027826 (so parameter/return types match exactly). Otherwise I will declare them with opaque pointer types.
- Confirm /GS- (no stack protector) or provide the __security_cookie/__security_check_cookie references if present elsewhere.

With that, I’ll emit LLVM 14 IR targeting x86_64-pc-windows-msvc that exactly matches the assembly and only declares true externals.
