I can generate LLVM 14 IR for this function, but a few critical details are missing/ambiguous from the disassembly that affect type correctness, external symbols, and data layout. To satisfy the strict rules you set (especially 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10), I need the following:

- Target triple and datalayout you want (e.g., x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu with the system’s datalayout). Rule 10 requires this to match the compilation environment.
- The definition and exact type of cs:qword_2038 (is it an i8*, i64, pointer to an array, etc.?). It’s loaded and then used to seed several stack slots that later appear to be indexed as 32-bit arrays; without its type, I’d be guessing and could violate rule 4 or 6.
- Whether to model the stack protector as in the assembly or compile with -fno-stack-protector. The disassembly clearly uses fs:0x28 and calls __stack_chk_fail on mismatch. If you want it modeled, I’ll declare and use @__stack_chk_guard and @__stack_chk_fail accordingly (rule 9).
- Confirmation to link against glibc and use int @__printf_chk(int, i8*, ...) for printing (rule 7). I will also declare malloc/free.
- If you want the constant strings materialized as globals, I’ll define:
  - "BFS order from %zu: " (21 bytes including NUL)
  - "%zu%s" (6 bytes including NUL)
  - "dist(%zu -> %zu) = %d\n" (23 bytes including NUL)
- Any constraints on pointer alignment for malloc result (so I can use the right address spaces/attributes).

Once I have those, I’ll emit a single LLVM 14 IR module that:
- Declares/defines the external symbols correctly (malloc, free, __printf_chk, optionally __stack_chk_guard/__stack_chk_fail, and cs:qword_2038 as extern or defined per your input).
- Implements main by faithfully modeling the stack frame behavior in the assembly (including the memset-like zeroing via rep stosq, the queue allocation/use/free, the conditional prints, and the final canary check), without undefined references, with correct types, and without invalid SSA or PHI construction.

Please provide:
- Target triple (and datalayout if you want it explicit).
- The exact LLVM type and linkage for cs:qword_2038 (and whether it should be defined or declared extern).
- Preference regarding stack protector (on/off).
