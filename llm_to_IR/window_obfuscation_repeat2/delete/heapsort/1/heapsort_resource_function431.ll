Please provide:
- The LLVM IR module text you’re trying to compile (full file).
- The exact error messages from llc/opt/llvm-link/clang (whichever fails), with command used.
- Target triple and datalayout if present; if missing, confirm it’s x86_64-pc-windows-msvc and LLVM 14.
- Any external functions/globals you expect (e.g., printf/scanf, __security_cookie) and whether /GS- was used.

With that, I’ll return a single corrected IR module that compiles.
