Short answer: this ELF builds a fixed undirected graph with 7 nodes (0..6) and prints the DFS preorder starting from node 0. The output is:
DFS preorder from 0: 0 1 3 4 5 2 6

What it does:
- Allocates three arrays:
  - visited[7] (ints) → r14
  - nextIdx[7] (qwords) → r15 (per-vertex “next neighbor to check”)
  - stack (qwords) → r12 (for iterative DFS)
- Builds an adjacency matrix A[7][7] on the stack (zeroed then specific entries set to 1):
  - 0: 1, 2
  - 1: 0, 3, 4
  - 2: 0, 5
  - 3: 1
  - 4: 1, 5
  - 5: 2, 4, 6
  - 6: 5
- Runs an iterative DFS from 0:
  - visited[0] = 1
  - Records preorder into a local array: 0, then each newly discovered vertex
  - Uses nextIdx[v] to resume scanning neighbors when backtracking
- Prints:
  - Header: "DFS preorder from %zu: " with 0 as the start
  - The preorder list with spaces between numbers and a final newline

If any allocation fails, it frees what it can and prints only the header and a newline.
