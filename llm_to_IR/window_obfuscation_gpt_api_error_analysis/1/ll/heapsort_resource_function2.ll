To generate correct LLVM IR for this routine, I need a couple of environment details and constraints confirmed:

- Target triple and data layout: e.g., x86_64-pc-windows-msvc vs x86_64-w64-windows-gnu. Rule 10 requires the triple to match your build environment.
- Are you okay with me replacing the gs:[0x30]+8 thread-unique owner value with GetCurrentThreadId() for the spinlock owner? Direct gs segment access isn’t directly representable in portable LLVM IR without target-specific inline asm.
- Please confirm the exact prototypes you want for the external CRT and Win32 APIs (msvcrt vs ucrt), so I can declare them precisely per Rule 7.
- Should I model all referenced globals (off_140004450, off_140004460, dword_140007004, etc.) as external declarations only, or do you want me to define any with initializers?

Once I have these, I’ll emit LLVM 14 IR that:
- Implements the cmpxchg-based lock with recursive ownership detection.
- Preserves control flow and calls to the imported functions as in your disassembly.
- Declares all externs with strict, correct types and avoids undefined references.
