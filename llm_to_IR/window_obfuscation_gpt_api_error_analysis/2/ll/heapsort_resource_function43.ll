What LLVM IR would you like me to generate? Please provide:

- Target triple (and optionally data layout), or your OS/arch/compiler (e.g., x86_64 Linux with clang 14).
- Exact function(s) to define: names, signatures, and behavior.
- Whether I may use libc (e.g., printf/scanf). If yes, Iâ€™ll declare them correctly.
- Any globals/strings you need.
- Whether to assume -fno-stack-protector (to avoid __stack_chk_guard).
- Any calling convention or ABI specifics beyond the default C convention.
