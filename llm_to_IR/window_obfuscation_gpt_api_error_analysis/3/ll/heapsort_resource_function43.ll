What LLVM IR would you like me to generate?

Please specify:
- Target triple (e.g., x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, etc.)
- The program’s behavior (e.g., a function, a full main, I/O, arithmetic, loops)
- Whether I can use libc calls (printf/scanf), or keep it freestanding
- Any constraints (no stack protector, optimization level assumptions, etc.)

I’ll ensure correct opcodes, unique SSA values, matching types, correct PHI predecessors, proper extern declarations, and no undefined references.
