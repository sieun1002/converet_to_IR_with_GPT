You are given an IDA function list (JSON). Select the minimal set of IR-worthy INTERNAL user-code functions. Exclude VMProtect runtime/glue/stubs. Output ONLY a JSON array of function names. No other text.

Rules
- Keep only internal executable functions that look like real program logic.
- Always exclude:
  - thunk==true OR category=="thunk"
  - category=="plt" OR segment startswith ".plt" OR name startswith "__imp_" or "_imp_"
  - names matching/starting with: _start, _libc_start_main, gmon_start, cxa, __chkstk, _scrt, .plt, _imp, j*
  - names containing: TlsCallback, CRT, atexit, initterm, dllmain, security_cookie, guard_check, guard_dispatch
  - blob-like functions: size >= 200000
- Core keep rule:
  - is_exec==true
  - segment == ".text" OR segment startswith ".text"
  - size >= 80
- VMProtect options:
  - if "IP(Importent Protect)" in PROTECTIONS: additionally drop size <= 16 wrappers
  - if "MP(Memory Protection)" in PROTECTIONS: do not include executable non-.text segments (treat as runtime)
- If callees/funcptr_targets exist: you may add referenced internal functions ONLY if they also pass all exclusions.

Return only:
["fn1","fn2",...]
